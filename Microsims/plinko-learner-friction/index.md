## Description

This MicroSim illustrates the **plinko board of exit friction** from the GED Testing Service product strategy (2026–2028). High-volume intake meets multiple friction points that can deflect learners before they credential. A ball represents a learner; labeled pegs represent friction points from "The Situation" in the strategy doc:

- **Family life** — ongoing family life challenges  
- **Life disruption** (×3 pegs) — health or events that take over day-to-day living  
- **Learning disabilities** — undiagnosed learning disabilities (e.g. dyslexia)  
- **Subject difficulty** — subject-area difficulty (math is the most common)  
- **Self doubt** (×2 pegs)  
- **Performance discouragement** (×2 pegs)

The ball funnels into one of **five outcome slots** at the bottom: **Never tested** (outside left), **Partially tested**, **Credentialed** (center), **Partially tested**, **Never tested** (outside right).

**Controls:** **Drop** — release the learner (ball); **Reset** — return to top and run again.

## Lesson Plan

- **Learning objective:** Learners will be able to explain the plinko board of exit friction by observing a learner (ball) deflected by labeled friction points and landing in an outcome slot.
- **Use:** Strategy discussions, stakeholder alignment, or adult-education professional development. Link to the full strategy doc for context.
