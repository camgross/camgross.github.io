<p>It's clear that I needed a push. Thank goodness, I found someone to give me one.</p>

<p>When I was in college, I didn't hear the signals that were telling me that a career in technology is path forward. There was a lot of noise in those years. For all kinds of reasons, I was focused on the fastest path to income. Perhaps I thought it was the easiest path.</p>

<p>In spite of the signals, I convinced myself I was a sales person, not an engineer.</p>

<p>Years later, when I joined my first software team, I reinforced the narrative that I am not an engineer. I felt like my technical learning was starting at zero. After nearly 17 years, this small website is the first "real" code I've ever produced.</p>

<p>I certainly dabbled in some drag and drop frameworks and tinkered with low-code platforms.</p>

<p>But thanks to a push from Dan McCreary, and the support of generative AI, I'm pushing commits.</p>

<p>Hello, World.</p>

<p><strong>W00t!</strong></p>
